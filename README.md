#The objective of the experiment is to build a database to recognize human activities using smartphones.
The objective of the assignment is to generate a tidy data set of this experiment data to give a meaningful insight of the experiment - a logical summary for initial interpretation

Experiment brief:
6 key activities are performed by 30 subjects to generate 2 data sets (randomly partitioned)
	- 70% - 21 volunteers 	for actual training data
	- 30% - 9  volunteers 	for test data

Each dataset contains:

	- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
	- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
	- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
	- Its activity label. 
	- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
